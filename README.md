# LangChain- Develop AI Agents with LangChain & LangGraph 🦜🔗

**Learn LangChain and LangGraph by building real world AI Agents (Python, Latest Version V.1.0+)**

This course is designed to teach you how to QUICKLY harness the power of the LangChain library for LLM applications. Build 3 end-to-end working LangChain based generative AI applications with no fluff, no toy examples - just real projects using real APIs and real-world skills.

## 💡 What You'll Build 

This course takes you through building 7 real-world AI agent projects, from simple hello-world applications to advanced agentic systems:

| Project | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| 👋 [LangChain Hello World](https://github.com/saurabhambar/langchain-project/tree/project/hello-world) | Branch (`project/hello-world`) | Your first AI agent - basic structure and LLM integration |
| 🔎  [Modern Search Agent](https://github.com/saurabhambar/ice_breaker/tree/project/search-agent) | Branch (`project/search-agent`) | Build search agents using LangChain v.1's `create_agent` interface with custom tools, Tavily integration, and structured outputs |
| 🔎 [Classic ReAct Search Agent](https://github.com/saurabhambar/langchain-project/tree/project/ReAct-search-agent) | Branch (`project/ReAct-search-agent`) | ReAct agent with search capabilities using the original `create_react_agent` from langchain-classic |
| 🧠 [ReAct Algorithm Under the Hood](https://github.com/saurabhambar/langchain-project/tree/project/ReAct-Algo) | Branch (`project/ReAct-Algo`) | Understanding reasoning and acting patterns in AI agents |
| 📄 [RAG Gist](https://github.com/saurabhambar/langchain-project/tree/project/rag-gist) | Branch (`project/rag-gist`) | The gist of retrieval-augmented generation |
| 📚 [Documentation Helper](https://github.com/saurabhambar/documentation-helper) | External Repo | Intelligent documentation assistant |
| 💻 [Code Interpreter](https://github.com/saurabhambar/langchain-project/tree/project/code-interpreter) | Branch (`project/code-interpreter`) | AI-powered code execution and analysis |
| 🪞 [Reflection Agent](https://github.com/saurabhambar/langgraph-project/tree/project/reflection-agent) | External Repo | Self-improving agent with reflection and critique capabilities |
| 🔄 [Reflexion Agent](https://github.com/saurabhambar/langgraph-project/tree/project/reflexion-agent) | External Repo | Advanced self-correcting agent using reflexion techniques |
| 🤖 [Agentic RAG](https://github.com/saurabhambar/langgraph-project/tree/project/agentic-rag) | External Repo | Advanced retrieval-augmented generation system |

## 📚 Course Highlights 

- **7 Complete Projects** - From beginner to advanced implementations including Ice Breaker, Documentation Helper, and Code Interpreter
- **Real-World Applications** - Build agents that solve actual problems with live APIs

## 🤔 Learning Path 

### Phase 1: Foundations
1. **Hello World Chain** - Basic agent structure and LLM integration
2. **Code Interpreter** - Tool calling and code execution capabilities

### Phase 2: Real-World Applications
3. **Ice Breaker** - Data collection and social media integration
4. **Documentation Helper** - RAG implementation and knowledge management

### Phase 3: Advanced Concepts
5. **Blog Analyzer** - Multi-step reasoning and content analysis
6. **Agentic RAG** - Self-correcting agents with memory and planning

## ▶️ Getting Started 

### 🛠️ Prerequisites 
- **This is not a beginner course** - Basic software engineering concepts needed
- Familiarity with: git, Python, environment variables, classes, testing and debugging
- Python 3.10+
- Any Python package manager (uv, poetry, pipenv) - but NOT conda!
- Access to an LLM (can be open source via Ollama, or cloud providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini)
- No Machine Learning experience needed

### ⚙️ Setup Instructions 

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saurabhambar/langchain-project
   cd langchain-project
   ```
2. **Choose your learning path**
   
   **For branch-based projects:**
   ```bash
   # Start with Hello World
   git checkout project/hello-world
   uv sync
   uv run python main.py
   
   # Progress to Code Interpreter
   git checkout project/code-interpreter
   uv sync
   uv run python main.py
   ```
   
   **For external repository projects:**
   ```bash
   # Clone specific project repositories
   git clone https://github.com/saurabhambar/ice_breaker
   cd ice_breaker
   # Follow project-specific setup instructions
   ```

3. **Follow the commits**
   - Each commit represents a lesson or feature implementation
   - Use `git log --oneline` to see the learning progression
   - Checkout previous commits to understand the development process

**External Projects:**
- [Ice Breaker](https://github.com/saurabhambar/ice_breaker) - Social media profile analyzer
